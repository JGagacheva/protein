# Protein

### Description
This project contains a pipeline for parsing and rendering PDB (Protein Data Bank) files combining Swift, Metal, and Obj-C.  

**Why visualize proteins in 3D?** The 3D structure of a protein largely defines its function. "The 3D structure of a protein is 
probably the single most useful piece of information scientists can obtain to help understand what the protein does and how it 
works in cells."

I hope this app helps anyone interested in learning more about proteins, or rendering, or both.
